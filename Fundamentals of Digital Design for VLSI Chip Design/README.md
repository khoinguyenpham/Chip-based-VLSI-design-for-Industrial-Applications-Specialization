This comprehensive learning module provides a detailed exploration of Boolean algebra and its practical applications in digital circuit design. Participants will delve into fundamental concepts such as Boolean variables, logic gates, and the relationship between Boolean algebra and digital logic circuits. The module progresses to cover Boolean expressions, simplification techniques, and the derivation of consensus theorems. Practical aspects, including the implementation of Boolean functions using universal gates and the use of Karnaugh maps for simplification, are thoroughly examined. The module also introduces the Quine McCluskey method as an advanced tool for Boolean expression simplification.

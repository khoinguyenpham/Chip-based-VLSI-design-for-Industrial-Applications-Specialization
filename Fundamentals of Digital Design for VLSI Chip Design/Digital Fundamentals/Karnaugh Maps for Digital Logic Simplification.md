K-map is generally effective for a moderate number of variables, but it becomes less practical for very few variables.

One of the advantages of the Quine-McCluskey Algorithm is that it can handle more than 6 variables.

The 'x' (cross) in the prime implicant table indicates the prime implicants that cover the corresponding minterms. Essential prime implicants are identified by examining rows with a single 'x', covering minterms.

Identifying essential prime implicants helps cover as many minterms as possible, contributing to a more efficient representation of the Boolean function.
